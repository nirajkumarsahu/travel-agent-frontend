          "I had a wonderful stay at the Arafa Inn. The staff were very friendly, respectful and great help in finding out how to get places. I would recommend staying here is you are a single woman travelling as I felt safe and respected. The room service is fast and most staff speak good english. It is in a fantastic location with some yummy vegetarian and chicken food  eateries nearby. The Breakfast at the hotel was included and very tasty, especially the fruit, plus the spices were mild, so it suited my western palate and I would recommend people new to India to stay here so you can ready your stomach for the spices. It is a short rickshaw ride from commercial street, UB City and Brigade road so very convenient if your up for a shop It is a 5 minute walk from Majestic bus depot making it the best place to stay if you get weary from travelling. Plus there is a gorgeous park nearby if you need to get out of the hustle and bustle of the streets. The hotel is very clean and well maintained, with fast wifi available. The linen was my favourite, comfortable beds and fantastic quality soaps and shampoo. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Arafa Inn and it will be the only place I stay when I go to Bangalore.",

          "This is an excellent hotel,I dont know why few peoples gave it one or 2 star,In a place like Mumbai thats also very near to Airport its room rates are competitive.It has everything,AC,LED TV,Geyser, WI FI,Excellent comfortable bed,Bathroom has soap,shower gel.Wi Fi is lightning fast speed,Room service upto the mark.Its value for money hotel,few people thinks they will get 5 star service by giving cost of 3 star! I strongly recommended this hotel. Mcdonald restaurant within 650 metres,come out of the hotel take right turn ,from the near by crossing take right turn,its before a culvert.I will come again in the month of August to stay there.Both the receptionist present in the night and morning are helpful, Even the lady receptionist provide a litre of mineral water before our departure. Thank you madam.Only thing missing was a ceiling fan.But your AC was turbo cool so its cools within 5 minutes.",
